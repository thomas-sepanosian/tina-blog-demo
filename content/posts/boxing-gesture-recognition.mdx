# Boxing Gesture Recognition

I recently published two papers exploring the use of wearable sensors for recognizing boxing gestures in real-time.

## The Research

The first paper, *[Boxing Gesture Recognition in Real-Time using Wearable IMUs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3675094.3680524)*, focuses on achieving accurate real-time recognition of defensive boxing gestures using inertial measurement units (IMUs). We developed a system leveraging Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to classify movements as they happen.

The second paper, *[Training with OpenEarable: A Boxing Gesture Recognition Dashboard Integration](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3675094.3678481)*, takes this further by integrating earable devices (OpenEarable) for motion data capture and providing athletes with a dashboard for performance analysis and training feedback.

## Key Takeaways

* Wearable sensors enable practical, real-time gesture recognition for sports training
* Earable devices offer an unobtrusive alternative for motion capture
* Visual dashboards help athletes understand and improve their technique

Both papers are available on the ACM Digital Library.
